                <p>The best “One quiver kite” on the planet still gets better over the years. Incredible control is coupled with a handling experience you will never forget. No matter what your level or style, the BANDIT is the kite that delivers.</p>

                <p>The C-Shape itself has always been the best option for making an easy to control and dynamic kite. To maximise the handling during intense moments such as loading up for pop and slack, and megaloops, we utilised a five strut design which keeps the profile exceedingly steady and gives our riders great confidence in the kite at all times. We decided to add a 5th line to help with control, optimise the power and also to enable them to relaunch the kite quickly with minimal effort.</p>

                <p>The BREEZE V2 is for anyone who wants a light weight set up that offers incredible handling with great low-end performance. Now with a range of sizes from 3m to 17m, it is the perfect kite for light wind freeriding, and foiling in any conditions. Thanks to its stability and light weight, the Breeze can show off interesting performances in light wind wave riding too.</p>

                <p>The FURTIVE features a high aspect ratio for high performance and 5 struts to control the profile. The leading edge arc is reduced to develop the maximum of power for a given area. Its profile has been developed to ensure maximum traction at the edge of the window. Its W5 bridle is totally innovative and brings together the function of a bridle and a 5th line! We have called it W5 due to its W pattern which includes a central line to control the leading edge arc, like a 5th line. It provides perfect distortion control and the central line further helps with the depower of the kite.</p>

                <p>Third generation of ram-air kite, the DIABLO V.3. is the result of an always evolving design work. This new version combines the ease of use that made our V.1. so successful with the performances needed to challenge for a World Champion title.</p>
