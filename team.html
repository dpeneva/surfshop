            <h3>Bjorn Monteiro</h3>
            <p>When I was 7 I started flying kites on the beach. At age 9 I started surfing and when I saw that the two of my favorite sports where getting combined, I was hooked from day one. I was 11 when I kitesurfed for the first time.</p>

            <h3 class="align-right">Terrell Woods</h3>
            <p class="align-right">Bjorn grew up in a small town in Durban. His father is a shaper, and he’s spent the majority of his life breathing foam dust and learning all he could about surf and board design. Currently sitting in the top 10 of the World Surf League, Jordy continues to push the boundaries of the sport with his athletic approach to surfing. From creative aerials to slashing, powerful turns, Jordy remains one of the best competition and free surfers in the world.</p>

            <h3>Liam Delanoy</h3>
            <p>'My dad took me to Langebaan, South Africa when I was a kid and within a few days I was hooked'. It was very clear from the beginning that Liam was destined for surfing greatness, particularly after he snared his first international title before the age of fourteen. Within two years, he had turned professional and quickly began imposing himself on the pro scene.</p>

            <h3 class="align-right">Oliver Sjostrom</h3>
            <p class="align-right">I was born and lived in Oahu, Hawaii until I was 5, and playing in the ocean off the North Shore hooked me for life. I'm addicted to the ocean and adrenaline rushes, so combining them both as a big wave surfer is my dream job.</p>

            <h3>Marvin Meyer</h3>
            <p>I grew up pretty much on the beach, with the ocean at my front door and the desert at my back. I lived and breathed the ocean every day throughout my younger years, which resulted in my severe distaste for cities and overpopulated places. I travel all year, but at the end of the day, all I want is to be back where the desert meets the sea.</p>

            <h3 class="align-right">Chris Osmond</h3>
            <p class="align-right">I joined Napili Canoe Club shortly after I moved to Maui in 2010, and after my first experience crossing the Pailolo Channel on a 6 man OC I was hooked on catching bumps. I couldn’t wait until the next year to ride bumps again, I bought my first sup which was a 14’ downwinder. Some of my best surf memories are still from sessions shared with just my childhood buddies and I scored some Gulf Coast surf at our home break when we were kids, it was such a rare treat to actually get fun waves in the gulf so when it happened it was always special.</p>

            <h3>Joyce Huis</h3>
            <p>The summer I turned thirteen I spent every minute riding with my friends at the local waterski club in the freezing water of Sweden. I learned my first invert with my dad as he was the only one who had enough patience to drive the boat. It took me endless tries, crashes, filling my wetsuit up with warm water and headaches but the moment when I landed my first backroll I discovered the warm and amazing adrenaline rush wakeboarding can give you. I’ve been chasing that feeling ever since.</p>
