                <p>The conception of this gun started in 2005! At that time, the great downwind races were looking promising: leaving downwind full speed onto the open sea with winds blowing above 30 kts appeared to me as the most thrilling discipline. We have therefore developed this specific gun shape but the trend then evolved towards windward/leeward, inshore racing.</p>
